# Quantum-Kernels-for-Classification
This GitHub repository features a comprehensive project implementing quantum machine learning (QML) techniques on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It combines classical data preprocessing with quantum computing methods to perform image classification. Key features include quantum feature maps, quantum kernel estimation, and comparison with classical SVM.

# Quantum Machine Learning with CIFAR-10

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of quantum computing techniques for machine learning tasks, specifically image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It employs a hybrid approach, integrating classical preprocessing methods with quantum algorithms to enhance the machine learning process.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7
- Qiskit
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- pylatexenc

## Setup and Installation
To set up the environment for this project, you will need to install the required Python libraries. You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install qiskit tensorflow scikit-learn numpy matplotlib pylatexenc
```

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset, a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, is used in this project. The dataset is processed and filtered to focus on two specific classes: cats and dogs.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including PCA and normalization.
- Quantum circuit implementation using Qiskit for feature mapping.
- Quantum kernel estimation for machine learning models.
- Classical SVM implementation for comparison.
- Performance evaluation and analysis.

## Usage
1. Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Implement the quantum feature map using Qiskit's `ZZFeatureMap`.
3. Construct a quantum kernel using the `FidelityQuantumKernel`.
4. Train and evaluate a quantum-enhanced SVM model.
5. Compare the performance with a classical SVM model.
