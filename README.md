# Quantum-Kernels-for-Classification
This GitHub repository features a comprehensive project implementing quantum machine learning (QML) techniques on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It combines classical data preprocessing with quantum computing methods to perform image classification. Key features include quantum feature maps, quantum kernel estimation, and comparison with classical SVM.
